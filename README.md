# JSON Parse Training

1. After cloning the repository run `php -S localhost:3333`
2. Go to `http://localhost:3333/index.html`
3. The basic page has jQuery 3.6.0, Bootstrap 5, and Axios to parse the endPoint data.
4. Under the scripts folder there's a `main.js` where all the logic must be placed.
5. I have created an endpoint that retrieves a list of products. `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/rpswallace/test/products`
6. Please create a new branch before starting a task, that way it can review it in an isolated way before continuing with the next one.

For all tasks use the following endPoint `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/rpswallace/test/products` and wireframe `https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOsZsYn0=/`. The main goal is not the styling, is the functionality, the way the endPoint is consumed and data parsed to reflect it in the browser. For styles, Bootstrap is available, please use it as needed, jQuery is also available.
